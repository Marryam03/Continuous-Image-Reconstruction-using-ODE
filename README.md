# Continuous-Image-Reconstruction-using-ODE
Image reconstruction approach  using continuous dynamical methods. Traditional tomographic  reconstruction techniques, such as the filtered back projection (FBP)  and iterative reconstruction (IR), have their limitations - FBP lacks  accuracy, while IR requires extensive computation times. To overcome  these issues, we propose a continuous-time image reconstruction (CIR)  system based on solving differential equations, an alternative to the  common discrete-time image reconstruction (DIR) systems. Our theory  suggests these CIR system trajectories converge to the optimal least  squares solution for the linear inverse problem.
